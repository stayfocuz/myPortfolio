🌐 Welcome to My Advanced Web Developer Portfolio

Thank you for visiting my personal developer portfolio — a thoughtfully crafted, fully responsive, and visually engaging website designed to present not just what I’ve built, but how I think, code, and create.
This portfolio is more than a digital resume — it’s a live demonstration of my front-end development skills and design sensibilities. Built using HTML5, CSS3, JavaScript, and Bootstrap 4, it features:

✨ Key Features
💡 Dynamic Light/Dark Mode: Intuitive theme toggle for user accessibility and personalization, with smooth transitions and icon-based switching.
🔊 Interactive Audio Playback: Background narration to enhance storytelling and user engagement, triggered on page load or user interaction.
🎨 Animated Skill Bars: Real-time animated proficiency indicators that highlight technical strengths in Python, Java, C++, JavaScript, and more.
🧩 Project Showcase (Carousel): A clean, Bootstrap-powered carousel showcasing real-world applications like a Real-Time Chat App, Regex to DFA Generator, and a Custom Calculator — all linked to their GitHub repositories.
🌌 Particle Background Animation: Custom JavaScript-driven particle effects that create a modern, immersive aesthetic.
📨 Contact Form Integration: A secure, styled, and validated form powered by Formspree — making it easy for employers or collaborators to get in touch.
🧑‍💻 Clean, Modular Code: Written with accessibility (ARIA labels), semantic HTML, and responsive design best practices, ensuring cross-browser compatibility and mobile readiness.

🎯 Why This Portfolio Stands Out
I built this site not only to showcase my technical skills, but to give potential employers and collaborators a feel of how I approach design, user experience, and interactivity. Every element — from animations to form validation — is handcrafted to reflect a balance between functionality and flair.
Employers looking for a self-driven, detail-oriented, and creative developer will find this portfolio to be a clear representation of what I bring to the table — the ability to write clean code, deliver user-focused solutions, and continuously learn and adapt in a fast-paced tech landscape.

🚀 Ready to Collaborate
If you’re looking for a web developer who combines technical depth with design thinking, and who can turn ideas into engaging digital experiences — let’s connect! I’m actively seeking internship and entry-level opportunities in software development and front-end engineering.

HTML5: Provides structured and semantic layout including headers, sections, and forms.
CSS3: Controls layout, animations, dark/light mode styling, and responsiveness — all included inline.
JavaScript (ES6):
🌗 Handles the theme toggle and icon switching.
📈 Animates the skill bars using the Intersection Observer API.
✅ Validates form inputs and shows inline error messages.
🎨 Generates particle background animation using <canvas>.
🔊 Manages audio playback with fallback interaction for browsers.
Bootstrap 4: Delivers responsive design elements, grid system, modals, badges, buttons, and carousels.
Formspree: Used to handle contact form submissions without server-side code.
